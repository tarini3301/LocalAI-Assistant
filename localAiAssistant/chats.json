    "User: hi",
    "Assistant: Hello! It seems like there's a problem with the model you are trying to run due to insufficient system memory. Your current setup only has about 3.1 GB, and your application requires at least 3.8 GB for optimal performance. Consider closing some applications or upgrading your RAM if possible to resolve this error.",
    "User: how are you",

    "User: hi",
    "Assistant: Hello there! If your issue is still unresolved after checking the RAM availability and possibly closing unnecessary applications as suggested earlier, we may need to look into other solutions such as optimizing the model for less memory usage or upgrading hardware. Let's tackle this together\u2014what else can I assist you with today?",
    "User: hi",
    "Assistant: Hello again! If there are any more questions on your mind, feel free to ask about system optimization, software updates that could help manage memory better, or anything related.
